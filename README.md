*Modern dashboard with real-time financial overview and interactive charts*

## Project Overview

Finance Tracker is a comprehensive personal finance management application that enables users to track income and expenses, manage custom categories, and visualize their financial health through interactive charts. The application features a secure authentication system, modal-based interfaces for quick data entry, and a responsive design that works seamlessly across all devices.

## The Why

Managing personal finances effectively is crucial for financial wellness, yet many solutions are either too complex or lack essential features. This Finance Tracker bridges that gap by providing an intuitive, feature-rich platform that makes financial tracking simple and accessible. With cloud-based storage and multi-device access, users can manage their finances anytime, anywhere.

## User & Business Goals

- **Secure Access**: Provide user authentication with CSRF protection for data security
- **Quick Operations**: Enable fast transaction and category management through modal popups
- **Visual Insights**: Offer clear financial summaries with interactive charts
- **Smart Organization**: Allow custom categories with transaction count tracking
- **Data Protection**: Prevent accidental deletion of categories with linked transactions
- **Universal Access**: Ensure responsive design works on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **Cloud Persistence**: Store data securely in PostgreSQL accessible from any device

## (UX) User Experience

Users can register for an account, create custom categories, and manage transactions through intuitive modal interfaces. The dashboard provides real-time financial overview with total balance, income, expenses, and visual pie chart comparison. Advanced filtering allows users to analyze transactions by type and category.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Port Already in Use**
```python
# Change port in app.py
app.run(debug=True, port=5002)  # Change 5001 to any available port
```

**Database Connection Error**
- Verify PostgreSQL is running

- Ensure database `finance_tracker` exists
- Verify username and password are correct

**Import Errors**
```bash
# Activate virtual environment
venv\Scripts\activate

# Reinstall dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Modal Not Opening**
- Ensure JavaScript is enabled in browser
- Check browser console for errors
- Clear browser cache
- Verify CSRF token is present

**Category Won't Delete**
- Check if category has linked transactions
- Look for lock icon (🔒) indicating protection
- Delete all transactions from that category first
- Transaction count is shown in the table

**Flash Messages Not Disappearing**
- Messages auto-dismiss after 5 seconds
- Click × to dismiss manually
- Ensure JavaScript is enabled
- Clear browser cache if issue persists

**Hamburger Menu Not Working**
- Test on screens ≤1024px width
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Ensure navigation IDs match JavaScript selectors
- Clear cache and reload
